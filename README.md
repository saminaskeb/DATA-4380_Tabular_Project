# Project Title

* **One Sentence Summary** This repository contains an end-to-end data science pipeline applying classification algorithms to the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from Kaggle to predict diabetes diagnosis.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on several health metrics. We formulated this as a supervised binary classification task using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Our approach included exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training using logistic regression and random forest classifiers, as well as performance optimization through hyperparameter tuning and SMOTE oversampling. The final tuned Random Forest model achieved an F1 score of approximately 70% on the validation set and generalized well on the test set.

## Summary of Workdone

### Data

* Data:
  * Type: Tabular data in CSV format, where each row represents a female patient of Pima Indian heritage and columns represent medical attributes (e.g., Glucose, BMI, Age).
  * Size: 768 records, 8 features + 1 binary target
  * Instances (Train, Test, Validation Split): 60% training, 20% validation, 20% test

#### Preprocessing / Clean up

* Describe any manipulations you performed to the data.

#### Data Visualization

Show a few visualization of the data and say a few words about what you see.

### Problem Formulation

* Define:
  * Input / Output
  * Models
    * Describe the different models you tried and why.
  * Loss, Optimizer, other Hyperparameters.

### Training

* Describe the training:
  * How you trained: software and hardware.
  * How did training take.
  * Training curves (loss vs epoch for test/train).
  * How did you decide to stop training.
  * Any difficulties? How did you resolve them?

### Performance Comparison

* Clearly define the key performance metric(s).
* Show/compare results in one table.
* Show one (or few) visualization(s) of results, for example ROC curves.

### Conclusions

* State any conclusions you can infer from your work. Example: LSTM work better than GRU.

### Future Work

* What would be the next thing that you would try.
* What are some other studies that can be done starting from here.

## How to reproduce results

* In this section, provide instructions at least one of the following:
   * Reproduce your results fully, including training.
   * Apply this package to other data. For example, how to use the model you trained.
   * Use this package to perform their own study.
* Also describe what resources to use for this package, if appropirate. For example, point them to Collab and TPUs.

### Overview of files in repository

* Describe the directory structure, if any.
* List all relavent files and describe their role in the package.
* An example:
  * utils.py: various functions that are used in cleaning and visualizing data.
  * preprocess.ipynb: Takes input data in CSV and writes out data frame after cleanup.
  * visualization.ipynb: Creates various visualizations of the data.
  * models.py: Contains functions that build the various models.
  * training-model-1.ipynb: Trains the first model and saves model during training.
  * training-model-2.ipynb: Trains the second model and saves model during training.
  * training-model-3.ipynb: Trains the third model and saves model during training.
  * performance.ipynb: loads multiple trained models and compares results.
  * inference.ipynb: loads a trained model and applies it to test data to create kaggle submission.

* Note that all of these notebooks should contain enough text for someone to understand what is happening.

### Software Setup
* List all of the required packages.
* If not standard, provide or point to instruction for installing the packages.
* Describe how to install your package.

### Data

* Point to where they can download the data.
* Lead them through preprocessing steps, if necessary.
